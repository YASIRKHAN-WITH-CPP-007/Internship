# Internship Project: Cybersecurity Tools

This repository contains a collection of cybersecurity tasks completed during my internship. It includes scripts and configurations for password cracking, network sniffing, wireless hacking, and vulnerability scanning. Each task is organized into its own folder, providing a hands-on exploration of various security techniques.

## Project Overview:

### Task 1: Password Cracking
Tools for generating password hashes and performing dictionary attacks to crack them.

### Task 2: Network Sniffing
A script for capturing and analyzing network traffic to identify potential vulnerabilities.

### Task 3: Wireless Hacking
Configurations and scripts to set up a fake access point, conduct deauthentication attacks, and crack WPA/WPA2 passwords.

### Task 4: Vulnerability Scanning and Exploitation
Scripts for scanning web applications for vulnerabilities and exploiting them using SQL injection, XSS, and directory traversal payloads.

## How to Use:
Clone this repository and navigate through each task to understand and execute the provided scripts. The included `README.md` file offers detailed guidance on how to run each script.
